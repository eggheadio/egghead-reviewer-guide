# Update Plunker

If you're here, you've determined that the lesson code in the current video you are reviewing needs to be updated.

Note which lesson this is in the Review Document but go ahead and update the example.

Our plunker examples load through github. This means we will need to check that the updated code will work in plunker then update the code found in github.

## Update the Code

The code examples are found underneath the video discription in the `code` tab of the lesson
![Code Example](../images/02-Update-Code/01-plunker-code-example.png)

_Step 1_
![Navigate to index.html](../images/02-Update-Code/01-navigate-to-index.png)

_Step 2_
![Note the version](../images/02-Update-Code/01-note-version.png)

In step 2 you’re also going to note the name of the framework, which is found right after the version number. Copy it but leave off the extension. So copy rxjs but leave of the .js in our case.

_Step 3_

![Navigate to unkpg](../images/02-Update-Code/01-use-unpkg.png)

You’ll then type in your search bar `unpkg.com/` then you’ll paste in the framework you just copied, you’ll then type in a `/` and hit enter.

_Step 4_ 

![click the framework + JS link](../images/02-Update-Code/01-Click-the-framework+js-link.png)

Note that the `bundle` file will often be named `umd` or `dist` but should contain the correct file regardless.

_Step 5_
