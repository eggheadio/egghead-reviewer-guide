# Update a JSBin Code Example

The new standard for our code examples is to use plunker. If you are here, that means you found a rogue lesson that is still using JSBin.

Note which lesson this is in the **Review Document** but go ahead and update the example.

This process requires that you are logged in with eggheadio JSBin credentials. If you don't already have this, request it. ðŸ˜„

## Watch the Video

First thingâ€™s first, you have to watch the egghead video that you are tasked with reviewing.

![Watch the video](../images/02-Update-Code/03-watch-the-video.png)

There are a few things you need to keep in mind while you watch the video

1. Pay attention to the code in the video, does it match the example code down bellow? 
2. Pay attention to how the resulting app works at the end of the video

After watching the video and keeping these things in mind you are next going to check out the example code below the video.

![Example Code](../images/02-Update-Code/03-example-code.png)

First youâ€™re going to update the example code to the latest version of the framework used.

Letâ€™s see how this is done.

## Update JS Bin 

_Step 1_

_Step 2_

In step 2 youâ€™re also going to note the name of the framework, which is found right after the version number. Copy it but leave off the extension. So copy angular but leave of the .js in our case. 

_Step 3_

![Navigate to unkpg](../images/02-Update-Code/03-use-unpkg.png)

Youâ€™ll then type in your search bar unpkg.com/  then youâ€™ll paste in the framework you just copied, youâ€™ll then type in a / and hit enter

_Step 4_

Then youâ€™ll copy the url!
